# temp-test-versioning
Temporary repo to test adding versioning to BrightspaceUI repos

## Versioning

Commits and PR merges to master will automatically do a minor version bump which will:
* Update the version in `package.json`
* Add a tag matching the new version
* Create a github release matching the new version

By using either **[increment major]** or **[increment patch]** notation inside your merge message, you can overwrite the default version upgrade of minor to the position of your choice.
